### Theory
Carbohydrates are one of the most abundant and essential organic biomolecules found in living organisms. They are composed of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O), typically in the ratio of 1:2:1. Carbohydrates serve as a primary source of energy and also play structural and functional roles in cells.

Classification of Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are broadly classified into three categories:

1. Monosaccharides – These are the simplest carbohydrates and cannot be hydrolyzed into smaller units..
     Examples: Glucose, Fructose.

2. Disaccharides – Formed by the condensation of two monosaccharide units. They can be hydrolyzed into two monosaccharide molecules. Examples: Sucrose, Maltose,                     Lactose.

3. Polysaccharides – Complex carbohydrates made up of multiple monosaccharide units. They serve as energy storage or structural components. Examples: Starch,                            Glycogen, Cellulose.

Principle of Qualitative Analysis
Qualitative tests for carbohydrates are based on specific chemical reactions that carbohydrates undergo due to the presence of functional groups such as:

  .  Aldehyde or ketone groups in monosaccharides (especially reducing sugars).

   . Glycosidic linkages in disaccharides.

   . Long-chain polymer structures in polysaccharides.

Each test uses a specific reagent to indicate the presence and type of carbohydrate by producing observable color changes or precipitates.

Common Qualitative Tests for Carbohydrates
1.  Molisch’s Test (General Test):

        .Principle: All carbohydrates are dehydrated by concentrated sulfuric acid to form furfural or its                      derivatives, which react with α-naphthol to produce a             violet-colored ring.

       .Inference: Positive for all carbohydrates.

2. Benedict’s Test (For Reducing Sugars):

       . Principle: Reducing sugars reduce cupric ions (Cu²⁺) to cuprous oxide (Cu₂O) in an alkaline medium, forming a           colored precipitate ranging from green to brick-red depending on the amount of reducing sugar.

       . Inference: Positive for glucose, fructose, lactose, and maltose.

3.Fehling’s Test (For Reducing Sugars):

        .Principle: Similar to Benedict’s test but uses Fehling’s A and B solutions. A brick-red precipitate of                   cuprous oxide confirms the presence of reducing sugars.

        .Inference: Confirms reducing sugars.

4. Barfoed’s Test (To Distinguish Monosaccharides from Disaccharides):

        .Principle: Monosaccharides reduce copper(II) acetate in an acidic medium more rapidly than disaccharides,               producing a red precipitate.

        .Inference: Rapid positive result indicates monosaccharides.

5.Iodine Test (For Polysaccharides):

        .Principle: Iodine forms a colored complex with polysaccharides like starch. Starch gives a blue-black color,             while glycogen gives a reddish-brown color.

        .Inference: Indicates the presence of starch or other polysaccharides.

6.Seliwanoff’s Test (To Distinguish Aldoses and Ketoses):

        .Principle: Ketoses react faster than aldoses with Seliwanoff’s reagent (resorcinol in HCl) to produce a red-            colored compound.

          .Inference: Red color indicates the presence of ketose sugars (e.g., fructose).
