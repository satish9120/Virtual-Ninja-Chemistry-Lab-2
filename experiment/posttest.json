        "a": "Benedict’s test is specific for reducing sugars, not all carbohydrates.",
        "b": "Correct! Molisch’s test is a general test for carbohydrates, where concentrated sulfuric acid reacts to form a purple ring.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Glucose is a monosaccharide and does not react with iodine.",
        "b": "Sucrose is a disaccharide and does not give a positive iodine test.",

        "a": "Correct! Benedict’s test detects reducing sugars (e.g., glucose, fructose) that form a brick-red precipitate.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Fehling’s test is similar to Benedict’s and detects reducing sugars.",
        "b": "Correct! Barfoed’s test differentiates monosaccharides (fast reaction) from disaccharides.",
        "c": "Seliwanoff’s test is specific for ketoses (e.g., fructose).",

        "a": "Glucose is an aldose, not detected by Seliwanoff’s test.",
