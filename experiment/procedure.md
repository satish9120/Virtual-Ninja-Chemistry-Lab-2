### Procedure
Qualitative Tests for Carbohydrates
Below is a step-by-step procedure for performing common qualitative tests to identify different types of carbohydrates.

1. Molisch’s Test (General Test for Carbohydrates)
Objective: To confirm the presence of carbohydrates.

Materials Required:
.	Test tube

.	Molisch’s reagent (α-naphthol in ethanol)

.	Concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄)

.	 Sample solution (e.g., glucose, sucrose, starch)

Procedure:
→ Take 2 mL of the sample solution in a test tube.

→ Add 2-3 drops of Molisch’s reagent and mix well.

→ Tilt the test tube and carefully add 1-2 mL of concentrated H₂SO₄ along the side to form a layer at the bottom.

Observe the formation of a purple/violet ring at the junction of the two liquids.

Expected Result:

Positive Test: Purple ring (indicates presence of carbohydrates).

Negative Test: No color change (absence of carbohydrates).

2. Benedict’s Test (Test for Reducing Sugars)
Objective: To detect reducing sugars (e.g., glucose, fructose).

Materials Required:
.	Benedict’s reagent (alkaline copper sulfate)

.	Test tube

.	Water bath

.	Sample solution

Procedure:
→ Take 2 mL of Benedict’s reagent in a test tube.

→ Add 1 mL of the sample solution.

→ Heat in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes.

→ Observe the color change.

Expected Result:

Positive Test: Green → Yellow → Orange → Brick-red precipitate (reducing sugar present).

Negative Test: No change (non-reducing sugar like sucrose).

3. Iodine Test (Test for Polysaccharides – Starch)
Objective: To identify starch.

Materials Required:
.	Iodine solution (I₂ + KI)

.	Test tube

.	Sample solution

Procedure:
→ Take 2 mL of the sample solution in a test tube.

→ Add 1-2 drops of iodine solution.

→ Observe the color change.

→ Expected Result:

Positive Test: Deep blue-black color (starch present).

Negative Test: No color change (absence of starch).

4. Barfoed’s Test (Distinguishing Monosaccharides from Disaccharides)
Objective: To differentiate monosaccharides (fast-reacting) from disaccharides (slow-reacting).

Materials Required:
.	Barfoed’s reagent (copper acetate in acetic acid)

.	Test tube

.	Water bath

.	Sample solution

Procedure:
→ Take 1 mL of the sample solution in a test tube.

→ Add 2 mL of Barfoed’s reagent.

→ Heat in a boiling water bath for 3-5 minutes.

→ Observe for a red precipitate.

Expected Result:

Positive for Monosaccharides: Red precipitate within 3-5 min (e.g., glucose, fructose).

Positive for Disaccharides: Red precipitate only after prolonged heating (e.g., sucrose, lactose).

5. Seliwanoff’s Test (Test for Ketoses – Fructose)
Objective: To detect ketoses (e.g., fructose).

Materials Required:
.	Seliwanoff’s reagent (resorcinol in HCl)

.	Test tube

.	Water bath

.	Sample solution

Procedure:
→ Take 2 mL of Seliwanoff’s reagent in a test tube.

→ Add 1 mL of the sample solution.

→ Heat in a boiling water bath for 1-2 minutes.

→ Observe the color change.

Expected Result:

Positive Test: Cherry-red color (ketose present, e.g., fructose).

Negative Test: No color change (aldose like glucose).
